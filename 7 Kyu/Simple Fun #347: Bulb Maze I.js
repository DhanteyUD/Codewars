/**
 * You walk in a maze. You need to reach the exit through many rooms.
 * These rooms are in a straight line.
 *
 * You can only walk in the dark. Otherwise, you will be caught by the enemy.
 *
 * Your trouble is that some rooms have light bulbs. If the light bulb is
 * bright when you enter the room. You were caught by the enemy.
 *
 * Fortunately, the status of these bulbs (on/off) is auto-switched every
 * minute. So you have a chance to go through the maze.
 *
 * Task
 * Let's us use a string maze to represent these roomsï¼Œ
 * like this: "xo oxox".
 *
 * "x" means there is a bulb in the room, and its initial status is off;
 *
 * "o" means there is a bulb in the room, and its initial status is on;
 *
 * " "(space) means a room without bulb, it's always dark.
 *
 * Your task is to determine if you can go through the maze.
 * Return true if you can, false otherwise.
 *
 * Note
 * Your initial position is the most left, the exit position is the most right.
 *
 * Your moving speed is 1 minute per step. You can not stop before you
 * start your moving until you reach the exit.
 *
 * Examples
 * For maze = "xo oxox". The output should be true.
 *
 * step 0 :  xo oxox
 *           ^ <--------You are here
 * step 1 :  ox xoxo
 *            ^ <--------You are here
 * step 2 :  xo oxox
 *             ^ <--------You are here
 * step 3 :  ox xoxo
 *              ^ <--------You are here
 * step 4 :  xo oxox
 *               ^ <--------You are here
 * step 5 :  ox xoxo
 *                ^ <--------You are here
 * step 6 :  xo oxox
 *                 ^ <--------You are here
 * step 7 :  ox xoxo
 *                  ^ <--------You've go through the maze :)
 * For maze = "xo  oxox". The output should be false.
 *
 * step 0 :  xo  oxox
 *           ^ <--------You are here
 * step 1 :  ox  xoxo
 *            ^ <--------You are here
 * step 2 :  xo  oxox
 *             ^ <--------You are here
 * step 3 :  ox  xoxo
 *              ^ <--------You are here
 * step 4 :  xo  oxox
 *               ^ <--------You were caught by the enemy :(
 * Happy Coding ^_^
