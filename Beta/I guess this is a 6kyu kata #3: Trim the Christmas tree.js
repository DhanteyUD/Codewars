 * Description
 * You have a Christmas tree. It is so lush that you can't
 * see the shape of the Christmas tree.
 *
 * abc
 * dsfsdfsdf
 * jweksaa
 * sdfjksdfjks
 * sdfjksdfkrc
 * sdjfksdfdsw
 * wejsdkj
 * sdjfksdft
 * We need to trim it, according to the shape of the
 * Christmas tree:
 *
 *
 * **
 * ****
 * **
 * ****
 * ******
 *
 *
 * Let's try to trim it, cut both sides, and keep the
 * middle part. You can assume that each string has an
 * odd length.
 *
 *    b
 *   sdf
 *  weksa
 *   ksd
 *  jksdf
 * jfksdfd
 *    s
 *    k
 * Note 1: At the top, three rows of "leaves" are a group.
 * Length starting from 1,3,5, and then 3,5,7, and so on..
 * If the length does not meet the condition,
 * please trim it into the "trunk".
 *
 * abc
 * dsfsdfsdf
 * jweksaa
 * jks
 * sdc
 * sdjfksdfdsw
 * wejsdkj
 * sdjfksdft
 *
 * Trim to:
 *
 *   b
 *  sdf
 * weksa
 *   k
 *   d
 *   s
 *   s
 *   k
 * Note 2: At the bottom, the "trunk" at least two lines.
 *
 * abc
 * dsfsdfsdf
 * jweksaa
 * jksjkbf
 * sdcfghr
 * sdjfksdfdsw
 * wejsdkj
 *
 * Trim to:
 *
 *   b
 *  sdf
 * weksa
 *   j
 *   f
 *   s
 *   s
 * Worst case scenario:
 *
 * abc
 * dsfsdfsdf
 * saa
 * jksjkbf
 * sdcfghr
 * sdjfksdfdsw
 * wejsdkj
 *
 * Trim to:
 *
 * b
 * d
 * a
 * j
 * f
 * s
 * s
 * Is this a Christmas stick? ;-)
 *
 * OK, that's all. I guess this is a 6kyu kata. If you agree,
 * please rank it as 6kyu and vote very;-)
 * If you think this kata is too easy or too hard,
 * please shame me by rank it as you want and vote
 * somewhat or none :[
 *
 * Task
 * Complete function trimChristmasTree that accepts a
 * argument tree, return a string like a Christmas tree.
 *
 * Don't forget the spaces on the left and the separation
 * symbols "\n".
